# Gemstone Identification System Using Deep Learning

## Overview

Sri Lanka, known as the "Gem Paradise," is home to some of the world's most exquisite gemstones, such as sapphires, rubies, and emeralds. The Gemstone Identification System leverages Deep Learning techniques to automate and improve the accuracy of gemstone identification, helping professionals in the Sri Lankan gem industry authenticate gemstones efficiently and ensure the quality of their trade.

This system utilizes a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** combined with a **custom deep learning model** and **InceptionV3** architecture, providing reliable identification even under challenging conditions like varied lighting and backgrounds. By integrating **image augmentation** and **denoising**, the model's accuracy and robustness are enhanced for real-world applications.

## Project Objectives

- **Support for Gem Industry Professionals:** Create a reliable tool for gemologists, jewelers, and traders to authenticate gemstones quickly and accurately.
- **Boost to Sri Lankaâ€™s Gem Economy:** Ensure the authenticity of Sri Lanka's gems, enhancing the country's global presence in the gem industry.
- **Preservation of Heritage:** Protect and promote Sri Lanka's rich heritage in gemology and its position as a global leader in the gemstone market.

## Technologies Used

- **Deep Learning (CNN)**
- **InceptionV3** Architecture
- **Python** (for model development)
- **TensorFlow** and **Keras** (for deep learning model implementation)
- **Image Augmentation** and **Denoising** techniques
- **Jupyter Notebooks** (for model training and evaluation)
