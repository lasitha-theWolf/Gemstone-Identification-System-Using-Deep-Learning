# Gemstone Identification System Using Deep Learning

## Overview

Sri Lanka, known as the "Gem Paradise," is home to some of the world's most exquisite gemstones, such as sapphires, rubies, and emeralds. The Gemstone Identification System leverages Deep Learning techniques to automate and improve the accuracy of gemstone identification, helping professionals in the Sri Lankan gem industry authenticate gemstones efficiently and ensure the quality of their trade.

This system utilizes a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** combined with a **custom deep learning model** and **InceptionV3** architecture, providing reliable identification even under challenging conditions like varied lighting and backgrounds. By integrating **image augmentation** and **denoising**, the model's accuracy and robustness are enhanced for real-world applications.

The system is capable of detecting **87 gemstones**, providing gemologists, jewelers, and traders with a powerful tool for identifying and verifying various types of gemstones accurately.
