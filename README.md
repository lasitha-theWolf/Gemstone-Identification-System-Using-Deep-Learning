# Gemstone-Identification-System-Using-Deep-Learning
This system leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with a custom deep learning model and InceptionV3 architecture. The project focuses on achieving high accuracy in identifying and classifying gemstones from images, even in challenging conditions such as varying lighting and backgrounds.
